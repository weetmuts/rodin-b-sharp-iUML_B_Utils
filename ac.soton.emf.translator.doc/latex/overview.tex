\section{EMF2EMF Translator Overview}
\label{sec:overview}

EMF2EMF is a generic framework for writing EMF to EMF model transformations in Java. Translators can be written by declaring a translator and a set of rule classes. Each rule class handles instances of a particular EMF meta-class as input. EMF2EMF provides a lightweight and efficient framework with a small footprint compared to declarative and interpretive M2M translators such as QVT, ATL or ETL. The down-side is that you have to write the details in Java instead of a nice declarative language. However, the framework structures your translation into manageable tasks to ease the task of writing your translator.
