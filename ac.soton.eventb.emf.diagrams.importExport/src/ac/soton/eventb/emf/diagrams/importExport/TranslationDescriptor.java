	/**
	 * A Descriptor for translated model changes. 
	 * The feature of the parent will be changed in the following ways:
	 * 
	 * 	If remove is false:
	 * 1) If the feature is a containment and the value is an element of the correct kind, the 
	 *    value will be added to the containment in a position according to the priority
	 * 2) If the feature is a reference and the value is an element of the correct kind, the 
	 *    value will be added to the reference in a position according to the priority
	 * 3) If the feature is an EAttribute and the value is of the correct type, the 
	 *    feature will be set to the value
	 *    
	 *    priority can be used to control the relative position of the translated elements  
	 *    1 - must come first
	 *    10 - not important
	 *    ---user entered items---
	 *    0 must come after user entered items
	 *    -10 must come last
	 *    
	 *  If remove is true:
	 * 1) If the feature is a containment and the value is an element of the correct kind, the 
	 *    value will be deleted from the containment
	 * 2) If the feature is a reference and the value is an element of the correct kind, the 
	 *    value will be removed from the reference
	 * 3) If the feature is an EAttribute, the 
	 *    feature will be unset
